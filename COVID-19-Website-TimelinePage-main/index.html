			<p1><br>Free Fire gives you the ablilty to take any charector in the game. But for most of the good charectors, suits, bundles, skins or anything that is abnormal, you need to pay diamonds(free fire's 2nd currency)for that.
			 </p1>How to get diamonds? You need to buy them from real money from the top up section. This gnme gives you the ability to make new friends and chat with them all day long.
			 This game can easily work on any device using upto an average of 1gb ram. "Download now! Trust me it is going to be really fun".
